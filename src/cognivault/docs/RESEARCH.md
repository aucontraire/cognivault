# ðŸ§  Research Foundations of CogniVault

CogniVault is a CLI-first, multi-agent knowledge construction system. Itâ€™s designed to simulate reflective thinking workflows using specialized agents that collaborate, critique, and refine user input into durable, structured Markdown notes.

## ðŸ§© Cognitive Architecture Inspiration

CogniVault is influenced by cognitive science models of how humans think in distributed, iterative cycles. It draws from:

- **Distributed Cognition** â€” The idea that cognition doesnâ€™t just occur in the brain, but is extended via tools and artifacts like notes, diagrams, and dialogue.
- **Metacognition** â€” Embedding self-reflection and critique into the knowledge process.
- **Zettelkasten** â€” A personal knowledge management (PKM) method based on linked atomic notes. CogniVaultâ€™s YAML+Markdown format mirrors these goals.

## ðŸ¤– Agent Role Design

Each agent in CogniVault has a functional persona:

- **Refiner**: Turns rough questions into structured insights.
- **Critic**: Identifies weaknesses, gaps, or assumptions.
- **Historian** *(planned)*: Tracks the lineage of insights and decisions.
- **Synthesis** *(planned)*: Merges and reconciles conflicting perspectives.
- **Planner** *(future)*: Proposes next steps or research directions.

These are loosely inspired by the **Society of Mind** (Marvin Minsky), where thinking emerges from interactions among simple agents.

## ðŸ›  System Design Principles

CogniVault is built on durable and ergonomic principles:

- **Markdown + YAML**: Chosen for their human-readability, portability, and ease of parsing.
- **CLI-first**: Enables composability, reproducibility, and automation.
- **Modular Agents**: Each agent lives in its own namespace with its own tests and logic.

The system is optimized for long-term thinking and externalized cognition.

## ðŸ§ª Research Opportunities Ahead

CogniVault opens up new directions for exploration:

- **Agent trace auditing** â€” Understanding how ideas evolve.
- **Semantic versioning of knowledge** â€” Using UUIDs, diffs, and lineage metadata.
- **Persistent multi-agent collaboration** â€” Extending context across sessions.
- **Multimodal cognition** â€” Incorporating diagrams, images, citations.

---

## ðŸ§µ Philosophy of Use

CogniVault is not just a tool â€” it is a **thinking partner**. It reflects the belief that structured reasoning and reflection should be:

- **Durable** â€” Exportable, portable, readable years from now.
- **Inspectable** â€” With clear agent attributions and timestamps.
- **Composable** â€” Easily integrated into larger systems or workflows.

Whether you're drafting research, brainstorming designs, or critiquing ideas, CogniVault helps you **think with memory**.
