## üîó LangGraph Architecture Details

### Node Interface Design

All agents implement the `invoke(state, config)` interface required by LangGraph:

```python
async def invoke(self, state: AgentContext, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> AgentContext:
    # LangGraph-compatible execution with configuration support
    return await self.run_with_retry(state, step_id=config.get("step_id"))
```

### Node Metadata System

Each agent provides comprehensive metadata for graph construction:

- **Node Type**: PROCESSOR, DECISION, TERMINATOR, AGGREGATOR
- **Input Schema**: Required and optional inputs with type hints
- **Output Schema**: Expected outputs with descriptions
- **Dependencies**: List of required upstream agents
- **Tags**: Categorization for filtering and organization

### Graph Builder Features

- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
- **Cycle Detection**: DFS-based cycle detection prevents infinite loops
- **Edge Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all edge endpoints
- **Graph Serialization**: Dictionary representation for LangGraph integration

### Execution Engine

The GraphExecutor provides:

- **Dependency-Aware Execution**: Proper ordering based on agent dependencies
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent agents can execute concurrently
- **Error Isolation**: Agent failures don't cascade to other agents
- **Execution Metadata**: Complete trace of execution order and visited nodes

This architecture provides a solid foundation for LangGraph migration while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows.
