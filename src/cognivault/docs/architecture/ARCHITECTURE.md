- **Nested Configuration**: Hierarchical Pydantic structure (`behavioral_config.custom_constraints: ["term1", "term2"]`) 
- **Automatic Translation**: Runtime format detection and conversion with validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full support for existing workflow definitions without migration

#### PromptComposer (662 lines) - Implementation-Ready Architecture
**Purpose**: Runtime prompt composition system transforming static agent behaviors into configurable workflow parameters

**Core Architecture** (ADR-006 Foundation):
- **Dynamic Prompt Composition**: Runtime generation from Pydantic configuration schemas
- **Behavioral Control Inversion**: Agent behavior controlled by configuration rather than code
- **Template-Based Composition**: Base prompts enhanced with configuration-driven modifications
- **Domain-Specific Specialization**: Academic, executive, legal variants through YAML configuration

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
```python
class PromptComposer:
    def compose_refiner_prompt(self, config: RefinerConfig) -> str:
        base = REFINER_SYSTEM_PROMPT
        if config.refinement_level == "detailed":
            base += "\n\nPRIORITY: Use ACTIVE MODE. Provide comprehensive refinements."
        if config.custom_constraints:
            base += f"\n\nADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS:\n" + "\n".join(f"- {c}" for c in config.custom_constraints)

The API boundary architecture implements a mock-first design strategy to prepare for future service extraction while maintaining current monolithic deployment efficiency.

#### External API Contracts (Stable Interfaces - Service Extraction Ready)
**OrchestrationAPI (v1.0.0)** - Production workflow execution interface:
```python
class OrchestrationAPI(BaseAPI):
    """Public API - EXTERNAL SCHEMA v1.0.0 - Breaking changes require migration path"""
    async def execute_workflow(self, request: WorkflowRequest) -> WorkflowResponse
    async def get_status(self, workflow_id: str) -> StatusResponse
    async def cancel_workflow(self, workflow_id: str) -> bool
```

**LLMGatewayAPI (v1.0.0)** - Future service extraction boundary:
```python
class LLMGatewayAPI(BaseAPI):
    """Future service extraction boundary - EXTERNAL SCHEMA v1.0.0"""
    async def complete(self, request: CompletionRequest) -> CompletionResponse
    async def get_providers(self) -> List[LLMProvider]
    async def estimate_cost(self, request: CompletionRequest) -> Dict[str, float]
```

class InternalWorkflowExecutor(BaseAPI):
    """Internal use only - v0.1.0 - Subject to refactor"""
    def _build_execution_graph(self, agents: List[str]) -> ExecutionGraph
    def _validate_workflow(self, graph: ExecutionGraph) -> ValidationResult
    def _optimize_execution_path(self, graph: ExecutionGraph) -> ExecutionGraph
```

**InternalPatternManager (v0.1.0)** - Pattern management internals:

- **Health Status Integration**: Standardized health reporting with dependency validation and status aggregation

**Mock Implementation Framework** (ADR-004 Foundation):
```python
class BaseMockAPI(BaseAPI):
    """Base mock implementation enabling comprehensive API testing scenarios"""
    def __init__(self, api_name: str, api_version: str):
        self._initialized = False
        self._health_status = APIStatus.HEALTHY
        self._failure_mode = None  # Configurable failure scenarios
    
    def set_failure_mode(self, mode: Optional[str]) -> None:
        """Configure failure scenarios: 'init_failure', 'execution_failure', etc."""
        self._failure_mode = mode
    
    async def health_check(self) -> HealthStatus:
        """Mock health check with configurable status for testing"""
        return HealthStatus(status=self._health_status, details=f"Mock {self._api_name}")
```

        bounded_context="transformation",
        processing_pattern="atomic"
    ),
    performance_metrics={
        "execution_time_ms": 250,
        "memory_usage_mb": 45,
        "success_rate": 0.98
    }

**Theoretical Foundation**:
The architecture is grounded in **Dual-Process Theory** from cognitive science:
- **System 1 Processing**: Fast, automatic operations achieved through streamlined agent configurations
- **System 2 Processing**: Deliberate analytical processing through the full 4-agent pipeline
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: ConfigMapper and PromptComposer enable agents to operate at different cognitive depths based on task requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- **Flexibility vs. Simplicity**: Fixed pipeline is less flexible but more predictable
- **Performance vs. Comprehensiveness**: 4 agents provide thorough analysis with acceptable latency
- **Cognitive Overhead**: Configuration system allows optimization for both utility and analytical tasks

### 9.3 Event-Driven Architecture

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive event system with multi-sink architecture

**Rationale**:
- **Observability Requirements**: Critical for production monitoring and debugging

- **Audit Trail**: Required for compliance and system analysis

**Implementation Choices**:
- **Multi-Sink Design**: Supports different output requirements (console, file, memory)
- **Correlation Tracking**: Enables distributed request tracing
- **Metadata Propagation**: Rich context for debugging and analysis

### 9.4 API Boundary Strategy

**Decision**: Implement external/internal API separation with contract testing

**Rationale**:
- **Service Extraction Readiness**: Prepares for future microservice architecture
- **Backward Compatibility**: External APIs provide stability guarantees
- **Development Velocity**: Internal APIs allow rapid iteration
- **Testing Strategy**: Contract testing ensures implementation consistency

**Benefits**:
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined service interfaces
