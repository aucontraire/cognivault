# CogniVault Pattern Registry

**Internal Documentation - v2.0.0**

This document provides comprehensive documentation for CogniVault's production-ready graph pattern system, used for LangGraph 0.6.4 orchestration and agent execution flows with advanced routing capabilities.

## Overview

The Pattern Registry manages execution patterns for CogniVault's production multi-agent system. Each pattern defines how agents are connected and the execution flow between them, enabling different orchestration strategies based on use case requirements.

**Current Status**: All patterns are operational with LangGraph 0.6.4 StateGraph integration, supporting real-time DAG execution with parallel processing, enhanced routing capabilities, and comprehensive observability.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GraphPattern (Abstract Base Class)**: Defines the interface for all execution patterns
2. **PatternRegistry**: Central registry for managing available patterns
3. **Concrete Patterns**: Specific implementations for different execution strategies

### Pattern Interface

```python
class GraphPattern(ABC):
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str: ...
    
    @property  
    @abstractmethod
    def description(self) -> str: ...
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_edges(self, agents: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]: ...
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_entry_point(self, agents: List[str]) -> Optional[str]: ...
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_exit_points(self, agents: List[str]) -> List[str]: ...
```

## Available Patterns

### 1. StandardPattern

**Type**: Sequential with parallel middle stage  
**Use Case**: Default CogniVault workflow for comprehensive analysis  
**Entry Point**: `refiner`  
**Exit Point**: `synthesis`

**Flow Structure**:
```
refiner → [critic, historian] → synthesis → END
```

**Characteristics**:
- Refiner processes and clarifies the initial query
- Critic and Historian execute in parallel after Refiner
- Synthesis integrates all outputs for final analysis
- Handles graceful degradation for missing agents

**Agent Dependencies**:
- Critic depends on Refiner output
- Historian depends on Refiner output  
- Synthesis depends on Critic and Historian outputs
- Direct refiner→synthesis connection when intermediates missing

**Parallel Groups**: `[critic, historian]`

### 2. ParallelPattern

**Type**: Maximum parallelization  
**Use Case**: Performance optimization when agent dependencies are minimal  
**Entry Point**: None (all agents start simultaneously)  
**Exit Point**: `synthesis` (if present) or all agents

**Flow Structure**:
```
[refiner, critic, historian] → synthesis → END
```

**Characteristics**:
- All non-synthesis agents execute in parallel
- Minimal dependencies for maximum performance
- Synthesis aggregates all parallel outputs
- Best for independent analysis tasks

**Agent Dependencies**:
- Only synthesis depends on other agents
- All other agents are independent

**Parallel Groups**: `[refiner, critic, historian]` (all non-synthesis agents)

### 3. ConditionalPattern (Enhanced Routing System)

**Type**: Dynamic routing with intelligent decision-making  
**Use Case**: Context-aware execution with performance-based routing  
**Entry Point**: Dynamic (based on routing decision)  
**Exit Point**: Dynamic (optimized based on context)

**Flow Structure**: Enhanced routing with multiple optimization strategies

**Current Capabilities**:
- **Context Analysis**: Real-time query complexity analysis via ContextAnalyzer
- **Performance-Based Routing**: Historical performance data integration
- **Resource Optimization**: Constraint-based agent selection via ResourceOptimizer  
- **Multi-Strategy Support**: Balanced, performance, quality, cost optimization strategies
- **Enhanced Conditional Pattern**: Integrated with EnhancedConditionalPattern system

**Advanced Features**:
- **Multi-Axis Classification**: 6-axis agent metadata system for routing decisions
- **Resource Constraints**: max_execution_time_ms, max_agents, min_success_rate filtering
- **Context Requirements**: Dynamic requirements analysis (research, criticism, synthesis needs)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Routing decision confidence with threshold-based validation
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time success rate and execution time monitoring

**Routing Decision Components**:
- **ContextAnalyzer**: Query complexity and requirements analysis
- **ResourceOptimizer**: Constraint-based optimal agent selection
- **PerformanceTracker**: Historical metrics and success rate tracking
- **RoutingDecision**: Comprehensive decision object with reasoning and metadata

## Pattern Registry Operations

### Registration
```python
registry = PatternRegistry()
registry.register_pattern(CustomPattern())
```

### Retrieval
```python
pattern = registry.get_pattern("standard")
edges = pattern.get_edges(["refiner", "critic", "synthesis"])
```

### Pattern Discovery
```python
# List all patterns
patterns = registry.list_patterns()
# {"standard": "Standard 4-agent pattern...", ...}

# Get pattern names only  
names = registry.get_pattern_names()
# ["standard", "parallel", "conditional"]
```

## Implementation Details

### Edge Generation

All patterns implement `get_edges()` to return edge definitions:

```python
edges = [
    {"from": "refiner", "to": "critic"},
    {"from": "refiner", "to": "historian"}, 
    {"from": "critic", "to": "synthesis"},
    {"from": "historian", "to": "synthesis"},
    {"from": "synthesis", "to": "END"}
]
```

### Agent Validation

Patterns can override `validate_agents()` for compatibility checks:

```python
def validate_agents(self, agents: List[str]) -> bool:
    # Custom validation logic
    return True  # Default: accept any agents
```

### Parallel Execution

Patterns define parallel groups via `get_parallel_groups()`:

```python
def get_parallel_groups(self, agents: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
    return [["critic", "historian"]]  # These can execute in parallel
```

## Usage in LangGraph Integration

### Production Graph Building (LangGraph 0.6.4)

```python
from cognivault.langgraph_backend.graph_patterns import PatternRegistry
from cognivault.langgraph_backend import GraphFactory, GraphConfig

# Modern pattern usage with GraphFactory
registry = PatternRegistry()
pattern = registry.get_pattern("standard")
edges = pattern.get_edges(["refiner", "critic", "historian", "synthesis"])

# Production graph creation with caching
graph_factory = GraphFactory()
config = GraphConfig(
    agents_to_run=["refiner", "critic", "historian", "synthesis"],
    pattern_name="standard",
    cache_enabled=True
)
compiled_graph = graph_factory.create_graph(config)
```

### Enhanced Routing Integration

```python
from cognivault.orchestration.orchestrator import LangGraphOrchestrator

# Orchestrator with enhanced routing
orchestrator = LangGraphOrchestrator(
    use_enhanced_routing=True,
    optimization_strategy=OptimizationStrategy.BALANCED
)

# Routing decision with context analysis
routing_decision = await orchestrator._make_routing_decision(
    query="Complex analysis question",
    available_agents=["refiner", "critic", "historian", "synthesis"],
    config={"max_execution_time_ms": 120000}
)
```

### State Management with Production Features

Patterns work with LangGraph StateGraph and CogniVault's enhanced state management:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from cognivault.orchestration.state_schemas import CogniVaultState

graph = StateGraph(CogniVaultState)
for edge in edges:
    if edge["to"] == "END":
        graph.add_edge(edge["from"], END)
    else:
        graph.add_edge(edge["from"], edge["to"])

# Production features: checkpointing, memory management
compiled_graph = graph.compile(
    checkpointer=memory_manager.get_checkpointer(),
    interrupt_before=["synthesis"]  # Optional validation gates
)
```

## Pattern Selection Guidelines

### Choose StandardPattern When:
- Running comprehensive analysis workflows
- Need structured sequential processing with parallel optimization
- Want reliable, well-tested execution flow
- Agent dependencies are important for quality

### Choose ParallelPattern When:
- Performance is the primary concern
- Agent outputs are largely independent
- Want maximum concurrency
- Processing time is more important than structured flow

### Choose ConditionalPattern When:
- **Production Use**: Need intelligent, context-aware routing
- **Performance Optimization**: Want optimal agent selection based on historical data
- **Resource Constraints**: Have execution time, cost, or quality requirements
- **Dynamic Workloads**: Context complexity varies significantly across queries
- **Advanced Features**: Need multi-axis classification and routing decisions
- **Observability**: Want detailed routing decision tracking and analysis

## Error Handling

### Missing Agents

All patterns handle missing agents gracefully:

```python
# StandardPattern with missing historian
agents = ["refiner", "critic", "synthesis"]
edges = pattern.get_edges(agents)
# Result: refiner → critic → synthesis → END
```

### Invalid Configurations

Patterns validate and provide fallbacks:

```python
# Synthesis-only configuration
agents = ["synthesis"] 
edges = pattern.get_edges(agents)
# Result: synthesis → END
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Dependencies**: High (structured flow)
- **Predictability**: High (deterministic flow)
- **Best For**: Quality-focused workflows

### ParallelPattern

- **Dependencies**: Minimal (synthesis-only)
- **Predictability**: High (simple structure)
- **Best For**: Performance-focused workflows

### ConditionalPattern (Enhanced Routing)

## Development Guidelines

### Creating Custom Patterns

1. Inherit from `GraphPattern`
2. Implement all abstract methods
3. Handle edge cases (missing agents, empty lists)
4. Test with various agent combinations
5. Register with PatternRegistry

```python
class CustomPattern(GraphPattern):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "custom"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Custom execution pattern"
    
    def get_edges(self, agents: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
        # Custom edge logic
        pass
    
    # Implement other abstract methods...
```

### Testing Patterns

```python
def test_custom_pattern():
    pattern = CustomPattern()
    
    # Test various agent combinations
    test_cases = [
        ["refiner", "synthesis"],
        ["refiner", "critic", "historian", "synthesis"],
        ["synthesis"],  # Edge case
        []  # Edge case
    ]
    
    for agents in test_cases:
        edges = pattern.get_edges(agents)
        # Validate edge structure
        assert validate_edges(edges, agents)
```
