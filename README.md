## 🧠 Agent Roles

Each agent in CogniVault plays a distinct role in the cognitive reflection and synthesis pipeline:

- ### 🔍 Refiner
  The **RefinerAgent** takes the initial user input and clarifies intent, rephrases vague language, and ensures the prompt is structured for deeper analysis by the rest of the system. It uses a comprehensive system prompt with passive and active modes to guide its reasoning process. See [`prompts.py`](./src/cognivault/agents/refiner/prompts.py) for implementation details.

- ### 🧾 Historian
  The **HistorianAgent** provides relevant context from previous conversations or memory. It simulates long-term knowledge by surfacing pertinent background or earlier reflections.

- ### 🧠 Critic
  The **CriticAgent** evaluates the refined input or historical perspective. It identifies assumptions, weaknesses, or inconsistencies—acting as a thoughtful devil’s advocate.

- ### 🧵 Synthesis
  The **SynthesisAgent** gathers the outputs of the other agents and composes a final, unified response. This synthesis is designed to be insightful, coherent, and markdown-friendly for knowledge wikis or future reflection.

### 📋 Agent Registry

The **Agent Registry** provides a centralized system for managing agent types, dependencies, and creation logic. It enables dynamic agent loading while maintaining type safety and proper dependency injection. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Registration**: Register new agents programmatically with metadata
- **Dependency Tracking**: Define agent dependencies for proper execution order
- **LLM Interface Management**: Automatically handles LLM requirement validation
- **Pipeline Validation**: Validates agent pipelines before execution
- **Extensible Architecture**: Prepared for future LangGraph integration

The registry supports both the current architecture and future dynamic loading capabilities, featuring:

- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic topological sorting of agent execution order using Kahn's algorithm
- **Failure Strategies**: Per-agent failure propagation policies (FAIL_FAST, WARN_CONTINUE, CONDITIONAL_FALLBACK, GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION)
- **Health Checks**: Agent validation system with configurable health check functions
- **Critical Agent Classification**: Distinguish between critical and optional agents for graceful degradation
- **Fallback Agent Support**: Alternative agent execution paths for failure scenarios

See [`registry.py`](./src/cognivault/agents/registry.py) for implementation details.

### 🧠 Enhanced Context Management

CogniVault features enterprise-grade context management designed to prevent memory bloat and provide robust state management for long-running agent conversations. Key features include:

- **Automatic Size Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of context size with configurable limits
- **Smart Compression**: Automatic gzip compression and content truncation when size limits are exceeded
- **Context Snapshots**: Create immutable snapshots of context state for rollback capabilities
- **Memory Optimization**: Intelligent cleanup of old data while preserving essential information
- **Parallel Processing Support**: Context cloning for safe concurrent agent execution

#### Context Management Features

The enhanced context system provides several key capabilities:

```python
from cognivault.context import AgentContext

# Create context with automatic size monitoring
context = AgentContext(query="What is AI safety?")

# Create a snapshot for later rollback
snapshot_id = context.create_snapshot(label="before_refinement")

# Add agent outputs (automatically monitored for size)
context.add_agent_output("refiner", "Refined query about AI safety...")

# Get memory usage statistics
usage = context.get_memory_usage()
print(f"Total size: {usage['total_size_bytes']} bytes")
print(f"Snapshots: {usage['snapshots_count']}")

# Optimize memory if needed
stats = context.optimize_memory()
print(f"Size reduced by {stats['size_reduction_bytes']} bytes")

# Restore from snapshot if needed
context.restore_snapshot(snapshot_id)

# Clone for parallel processing
cloned_context = context.clone()
```

#### Configurable Context Settings

Context management behavior can be configured via environment variables:

```env
# Context size limits (default: 1MB)
COGNIVAULT_MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE_BYTES=1048576

# Maximum snapshots to keep (default: 5)
COGNIVAULT_MAX_SNAPSHOTS=5

# Enable automatic compression (default: true)
COGNIVAULT_ENABLE_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION=true

# Compression threshold (default: 0.8 = 80% of max size)
COGNIVAULT_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD=0.8
```

The context management system automatically:
- Monitors context size during agent operations
- Applies compression when size limits are exceeded
- Truncates large outputs intelligently
- Maintains agent trace history with size limits
- Provides detailed memory usage statistics

This ensures CogniVault can handle long-running conversations and complex multi-agent workflows without memory issues, making it suitable for production deployments and extended research sessions.

### 🔗 LangGraph Compatibility Layer

CogniVault features a complete LangGraph compatibility layer that provides DAG-ready architecture while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows. This foundation enables seamless future migration to LangGraph-based orchestration.

#### LangGraph Node Interface

All agents implement the standard LangGraph node interface:

```python
from cognivault.agents.refiner.agent import RefinerAgent
from cognivault.context import AgentContext

agent = RefinerAgent(llm)
context = AgentContext(query="Your question")

# LangGraph-compatible interface
result = await agent.invoke(context, config={"step_id": "custom_id"})

# Traditional interface still works
result = await agent.run_with_retry(context)
```

#### Node Metadata System

Each agent provides comprehensive metadata for graph construction:

```python
# Get complete node definition
node_def = agent.get_node_definition()

print(f"Node ID: {node_def.node_id}")
print(f"Type: {node_def.node_type}")  # PROCESSOR, AGGREGATOR, etc.
print(f"Dependencies: {node_def.dependencies}")
print(f"Inputs: {[inp.name for inp in node_def.inputs]}")
print(f"Outputs: {[out.name for out in node_def.outputs]}")

# Convert to dictionary for graph builders
graph_config = node_def.to_dict()
```

#### Graph Builder Infrastructure

Build and execute DAGs with automatic dependency resolution:

```python
from cognivault.langraph.graph_builder import GraphBuilder, GraphExecutor

# Build graph from agents
builder = GraphBuilder()
builder.add_agents([refiner, critic, historian, synthesis])

# Create validated DAG
graph_def = builder.build()

# Execute graph
executor = GraphExecutor(graph_def, agents_dict)
result = await executor.execute(initial_context)
```

### 🔀 Failure Propagation & Conditional Execution

CogniVault features a sophisticated failure propagation system designed for LangGraph DAG compatibility. The system provides conditional execution semantics, graceful degradation strategies, and intelligent dependency resolution.

#### Failure Propagation Strategies

Each agent can be configured with specific failure handling strategies:

- **FAIL_FAST**: Stop immediately on any failure (default for critical agents)
- **WARN_CONTINUE**: Log warning but continue execution (for optional components)  
- **CONDITIONAL_FALLBACK**: Try alternative execution paths
- **GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION**: Skip non-critical agents and continue with reduced functionality

#### Execution Path Tracking

The system tracks execution paths for future LangGraph DAG migration:

- **NORMAL**: Standard execution flow
- **FALLBACK**: Alternative execution when primary agent fails
- **DEGRADED**: Reduced functionality mode
- **RECOVERY**: Recovery from previous failures

#### Agent Dependency Resolution

CogniVault automatically resolves agent dependencies using topological sorting:

- **Dependency Tracking**: Define which agents depend on others
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Prevents infinite dependency loops
- **Optimal Execution Order**: Automatically determines best execution sequence
- **Health Checks**: Validates agent readiness before execution

#### Example: Conditional Execution Configuration

The orchestrator automatically handles different failure strategies:

- **Critical agent failures** (Refiner): FAIL_FAST - stops execution immediately
- **Optional agent failures** (Critic): GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION - skips and continues
- **Warning-only failures** (Historian): WARN_CONTINUE - logs warning but continues
- **Fallback strategies** (Synthesis): CONDITIONAL_FALLBACK - tries alternative paths

```python
orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
context = await orchestrator.run("Your question")

# Check execution path and degradation status
if context.execution_edges:
    print(f"Execution path: {context.path_metadata}")
if context.conditional_routing:
    print(f"Conditional decisions: {context.conditional_routing}")
```

#### LangGraph DAG Compatibility

The failure propagation system is designed for seamless LangGraph migration:

- **Node Isolation**: Each agent operates as an isolated node with error boundaries
- **Conditional Edges**: Failure strategies map directly to LangGraph conditional routing
- **State Management**: Execution context preserves state for DAG reentrance
- **Edge Metadata**: All execution decisions are tracked for DAG edge configuration

### 🏗️ API Boundary Implementation (Phase 3A.2)

CogniVault features a sophisticated API boundary implementation following ADR-004 specifications that establishes clear external/internal API separation and enables future service extraction.

#### BaseAPI Interface Pattern

All APIs implement a standardized `BaseAPI` interface with lifecycle management:

```python
from cognivault.api.external import OrchestrationAPI
from cognivault.api.models import WorkflowRequest

# External API with stable interface
api = LangGraphOrchestrationAPI()  # Production implementation
await api.initialize()

# Execute workflow through API boundary
request = WorkflowRequest(
    query="What are the implications of AI governance?",
    agents=["refiner", "critic", "historian", "synthesis"]
)
response = await api.execute_workflow(request)
print(f"Workflow {response.workflow_id}: {response.status}")
```

#### Mock-First Design & Contract Testing

Comprehensive mock implementations enable immediate testing and parallel development:

```python
from tests.fakes.mock_orchestration import MockOrchestrationAPI

# Mock API for testing - identical interface
mock_api = MockOrchestrationAPI()
await mock_api.initialize()

# Configure failure scenarios for testing
mock_api.set_failure_mode("execution_failure")
mock_api.set_agent_outputs({"refiner": "Custom mock output"})

# All contract tests pass for both real and mock implementations
response = await mock_api.execute_workflow(request)
```

#### Key API Boundary Features

- **External API Contracts**: `OrchestrationAPI`, `LLMGatewayAPI` with backward compatibility guarantees

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Management

CogniVault features a comprehensive configuration system that centralizes all application settings, replacing scattered magic numbers and constants throughout the codebase. The configuration system supports multiple environments and provides flexible configuration through environment variables and JSON files.

### Configuration Categories

- **ExecutionConfig**: Agent timeouts, retries, simulation delays, and pipeline settings
- **FileConfig**: Directory paths, file size limits, filename generation settings
- **ModelConfig**: LLM provider settings, token limits, temperature, and mock data
- **TestConfig**: Testing timeouts, simulation settings, and mock history data

### Environment Variables

Configure CogniVault using `COGNIVAULT_*` prefixed environment variables:

```env
# Environment and logging
COGNIVAULT_ENV=development  # development, testing, production
COGNIVAULT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO   # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
COGNIVAULT_DEBUG=false      # Enable debug mode

# Execution settings
COGNIVAULT_MAX_RETRIES=3

COGNIVAULT_MAX_SNAPSHOTS=5
COGNIVAULT_ENABLE_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION=true
COGNIVAULT_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD=0.8
```

### JSON Configuration Files

You can also use JSON configuration files for more complex setups:

```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "debug_mode": false,
  "execution": {
    "max_retries": 5,
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "critic_enabled": true,
    "default_agents": ["refiner", "historian", "critic", "synthesis"]
  },
  "files": {
    "notes_directory": "/app/data/notes",
    "logs_directory": "/app/data/logs"
  },
  "models": {
    "default_provider": "openai",
    "temperature": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Programmatic Configuration

For advanced use cases, you can configure CogniVault programmatically:

```python
from cognivault.config.app_config import ApplicationConfig, Environment, set_config

# Create custom configuration
config = ApplicationConfig()
config.environment = Environment.PRODUCTION
config.execution.max_retries = 5
config.files.notes_directory = "/custom/path"

# Set as global configuration
set_config(config)

# Load from file
config = ApplicationConfig.from_file("/path/to/config.json")
set_config(config)
```

### Environment-Specific Behavior

The configuration system automatically adjusts behavior based on the environment:

- **Development**: Standard timeouts and full logging
- **Testing**: Extended timeouts (multiplied by `test_timeout_multiplier`), simulation enabled
- **Production**: Optimized settings, reduced logging

### Configuration Validation

All configuration values are automatically validated with clear error messages:

```python
config = ApplicationConfig()
config.execution.max_retries = -1  # Invalid
errors = config.validate()
# Returns: ["max_retries must be non-negative"]
```

---

## 🔐 LLM Configuration

CogniVault supports OpenAI out of the box via a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```env
# LLM Provider Configuration
COGNIVAULT_LLM=openai  # Change to "stub" to use a mock LLM for testing

# OpenAI-specific settings (only required when using OpenAI)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional

# Model behavior (part of configuration system)
COGNIVAULT_MAX_TOKENS=4096
COGNIVAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

You can define new LLM backends by extending the `LLMInterface` and registering them in the `LLMFactory`. The active backend is selected via the environment variable `COGNIVAULT_LLM`.

The LLM backend is now part of the centralized configuration system. Set `COGNIVAULT_LLM=openai` for OpenAI or `COGNIVAULT_LLM=stub` for testing with mock responses.

The `OPENAI_*` variables are only required when using the OpenAI backend:

---

## 🧩 Advanced: Adding a Custom LLM

To integrate your own model (e.g. hosted model or different provider like Anthropic, Mistral, or local inference):

1. **Implement the interface**:
   Create a new class that inherits from `LLMInterface` in `src/cognivault/llm/llm_interface.py`.  
   Note that the `generate` method now supports an optional `system_prompt` parameter to provide more flexible prompt control.

2. **Add to factory**:
   Register your new implementation in `LLMFactory` (`src/cognivault/llm/factory.py`) under a new provider name.

3. **Update the enum**:
   Add your provider to `LLMProvider` in `src/cognivault/llm/provider_enum.py`.

4. **Configure it**:
   In your `.env`, set:
   ```
   COGNIVAULT_LLM=yourprovider
   ```

This approach allows you to cleanly swap or combine LLMs in the future with minimal change to your orchestrator or agent code.

---

## 🖥️ Usage

### Run the assistant

Make sure your `.env` file is configured with your OpenAI credentials if using the OpenAI LLM backend.

To run the full pipeline with all agents:

```bash
make run QUESTION="Is democracy becoming more robust globally?"
```

This executes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m cognivault.cli "$(QUESTION)" $(if $(AGENTS),--agents=$(AGENTS),) $(if $(LOG_LEVEL),--log-level=$(LOG_LEVEL),) $(if $(EXPORT_MD),--export-md,) $(if $(TRACE),--trace,) $(if $(HEALTH_CHECK),--health-check,) $(if $(DRY_RUN),--dry-run,) $(if $(EXPORT_TRACE),--export-trace=$(EXPORT_TRACE),)
```

⚠️ Note: `$(QUESTION)` is a Makefile variable — this syntax only works with `make run`. If you're calling the Python CLI directly, use standard shell quotes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m cognivault.cli "What is cognition?" --agents=refiner,critic
```

You can also run a **single agent in isolation** using the `AGENTS` environment variable:

```bash
make run QUESTION="What are the benefits of a polycentric governance model?" AGENTS=refiner
make run QUESTION="How does historical context affect AI safety debates?" AGENTS=critic
make run QUESTION="What long-term trends influence democratic erosion?" AGENTS=historian
make run QUESTION="What’s the synthesized conclusion from all agents?" AGENTS=synthesis
```

This maps to the CLI flag `--agents=name1,name2`, allowing you to run any combination of agents by name. Leave unset to run the full pipeline.

### Control Log Level

You can control the logging verbosity using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Available levels include `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`.

```bash
make run QUESTION="your query here" AGENTS=refiner,critic LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

This helps in debugging and understanding agent behavior during development.

### Export Markdown Output

To save the output of agent responses as a markdown file (for integration into a personal wiki or digital garden), use the `EXPORT_MD=1` flag:

```bash

make test-agent-refiner    # Refiner agent batch testing
make test-agent-critic     # Critic agent batch testing
```

### View Coverage

Run the full test suite with a coverage report:

```bash
make coverage-all
```

### Control Log Level During Coverage

You can set a log level when running test coverage to see debug output during test runs:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG make coverage-all
```

This can help trace detailed agent behavior while viewing test coverage results.

This executes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest --cov=cognivault --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```

Run coverage on a specific module:

```bash
make coverage-one m=cli LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

- `m` is required — it's the submodule path under `cognivault`.
- `LOG_LEVEL` is optional (defaults to `WARNING`). Set it to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to see logging output during test runs.

💡 Example:
```bash
make coverage-one m=orchestrator LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

---

## 📈 Prompt Evaluation Tools

We provide specialized tools for evaluating prompt performance and behavior:

- `scripts/agents/refiner/test_batch.py` runs batch tests on the Refiner agent's prompts, enabling detailed analysis of output variations
- `scripts/agents/critic/test_batch.py` runs batch tests on the Critic agent's cognitive reflection pipeline, testing bias detection and confidence scoring
- Both tools include git version metadata in their output to help track prompt changes and reproducibility

These tools facilitate prompt tuning and validation during development and experimentation, ensuring consistent agent behavior across different scenarios.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

CogniVault can serve as a:

- 🧠 Personal knowledge management tool (Zettelkasten, digital garden)
- 💬 Reflection assistant for journaling or ideation
- 📚 Research co-pilot for synthesis and argument mapping
- 🧵 Semantic trace explorer for AI explainability
- 🧪 Experimentation harness for multi-agent reasoning

Future directions: wiki export, browser UI, plugin support (Obsidian, Notion).

---

## 🌍 How CogniVault Differs

Unlike typical LLM assistants or AutoGPT-style agents, CogniVault focuses on *structured introspection* rather than task completion. While tools like LangGraph or Reflexion optimize for task-solving or dynamic planning, CogniVault enables long-term insight formation across modular agent roles — including Refiner, Historian, Critic, and Synthesis.

It’s designed as a memory-enhanced thinking partner that integrates cleanly with personal wikis, supports test-driven CLI use, and remains light enough for future microservice deployment or API integration.
